EDeR: A Dataset for Exploring Event Dependency Relations Between Events (sibmitted to SIGIR2023 Resource Paper)

EDeR is a human-annotated dataset that extracts event dependency information from events and provides refined semantic role-labelled event representations based on this information. We also provide baseline models for further research.
